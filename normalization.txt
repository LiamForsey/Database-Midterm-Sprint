All three tables—Movies, Customers, and Rentals—are set up to meet the requirements of third normal form. This means they keep data organized by
making sure every piece of information depends on its main identifier (the primary key) and that there aren’t any unnecessary links between 
non-key attributes. This helps cut down on repeated data and avoids problems when updating information.
